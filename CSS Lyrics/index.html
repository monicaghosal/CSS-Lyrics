            Don't go tonight
            <br>Stay here one more time
            <br>Remind me what it's like, oh
            <br>And let's fall in love one more time
            <br>I need you now by my side
            <br>It tears me up when you turn me down
            <br>I'm begging please, just stick around

            <br>I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy
